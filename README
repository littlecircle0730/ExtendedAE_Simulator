# ExtendedAE Simulator

This simulator supports CND extensions from the paper "Advanced Continuous Neighbor Discovery Methods for Enhancing Data Exchange". It includes configurations such as CodingAW and ExtAW, built on top of base protocols like BLEnd and Nihao. ExtBeacon is maintained separately.

To run simulations, first use one of the `generate_multiple_properties_*.sh` scripts to generate the necessary `.properties` configuration files. For example, you can run `./generate_multiple_properties_ExtAW.sh`, `./generate_multiple_properties_CodingAW.sh`, or `./generate_multiple_properties_Nihoa_ExtendedAE.sh` depending on the protocol variant you want to simulate. The input files are the output from analytical models. These scripts produce one or more `.properties` files which define the simulation parameters such as discovery probability (`disc_prob`), number of nodes, number of runs, and so on. You can modify the scripts to adjust any of these parameters as needed.

After the properties files are generated, execute the corresponding `run_*.sh` script to start the simulations. For example, use `./run_Extended.sh`, `./run_BLEndAE.sh`, or `./run_NihaoExtendedAE.sh` based on which protocol you're simulating. These scripts automatically detect the generated `.properties` files and invoke the simulator with the correct parameters multiple times as defined in the script logic. You do not need to compile or run the Java class manuallyâ€”everything is handled through the shell scripts.

Simulation results are saved into `.log` files, usually named according to the protocol and configuration used. The log format depends on what is specified in the corresponding `.properties` file.

Everything can be driven through the `.sh` scripts. You only need to modify the generation parameters, run the scripts, and collect the logs for analysis.
